# Andromeda Public RPC

Public RPC offers HTTP-based access from IRS (Interchains RPC Scanner) to on-chain data. We maintain a node list of those output public endpoints, although we do not control or validate the data. For increased reliability, we recommend using our managed RPC nodes!

Validators and high-voting-power sentries pose security risks when exposed to the public network. Node operators should protect their validator infrastructure with strong firewall rules.
